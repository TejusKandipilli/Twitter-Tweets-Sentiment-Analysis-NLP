# Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression

This GitHub repository contains a project focused on Sentiment Analysis using a Logistic Regression machine learning model. The model is trained on a dataset comprising 1.6 million tweets, allowing it to predict whether a given tweet is positive or negative.

## Overview

Sentiment Analysis involves determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text, making it valuable for understanding public opinion. In this project, we leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to train a Logistic Regression model, which excels in binary classification tasks. The model is then integrated into a user-friendly GUI application.

## Features

- **Logistic Regression Model**: A robust machine learning model trained on a large dataset for accurate sentiment predictions.
- **1.6 Million Tweets Dataset**: The model is trained on a diverse dataset of tweets to capture a wide range of sentiments.
- **GUI Application**: The trained model is seamlessly integrated into a graphical user interface, enabling users to input text and receive predictions on whether the entered message is positive or negative.
